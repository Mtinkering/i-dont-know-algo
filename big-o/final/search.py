arr[integers]

smallest positive number that does not exist in the array


arr = [-5, 9, -7, 1]

[1, 2, 3] = > 4

ans = 1


minVal = min(arr)
maxval = max


arr = > set of numbers
if minVal < 0:
    from 1 -> increase until it''s not in the set, and positive

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 8, 9] = > a set
time: O(N)
space: O(N)


time O(N)
space O(1)

arr = [0, 9, 0, 2, 1]  # cant sort
3 positive numbers

[-5, 8, 9, 10]
[1, maxVal + 1]


arr = [-5, 9, -7, 5]


[1, N + 1]
# . [1-4]
# arr = [0,0,0,0]
# ans = max(arr) + 1


# [3, 5, 4] [1-3]
arr = [0, 2, 3]

arr = [0, -2, -3]
