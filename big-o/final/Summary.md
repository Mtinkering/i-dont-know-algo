Algorithms on weighted graph

Dijkstra: Single source
- Non negative weights
  
Bellman-ford: Single source
- Negative weights
- O(E.V)

Floyd Warshall:
- multiple sources
- Negative weights
- O(V*3)

Binary Search

Binary Search Tree:
- structure
- operations on the tree:
  - Insert Node
  - delete Node
  - Traverse tree
  - Map/Set (tree)

Prim: Minimum Spanning Tree:
- min sum of edges
- n-1 edges
- look for the nearest
- O(ElogV) ~ O(ElogE)

Trie: dictionary tree
- insert
- delete
- search

DSU
- Find 2 items are on the same set or not
- manage sets

Kruskal
- Use DSU for minimum spanning tree
- O(ElogE)
