# To read for Amazon:
### *Object Oriented Design*
You should have a working knowledge of a few common and useful design patterns (singleton, factory, adapter, bridge, visitor, command, proxy, observer, etc.) as well as know how to write software in an object oriented way with appropriate use of inheritance and aggregation.

# Space complexity:
For space complexity calculation, it is fair to assume the input array or list is already in memory. So space complexity is the extra space needed


# Summary
- Trie:
  - Children of the node
  - 2 main methods: addNode and findNode, iteratively
