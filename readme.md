# Interesting Algo and DS problems that I have been solving

### Steps to be better (Found on the internet which I find useful):

1. Do normal implementations and problems using your own language

2. Learn data structures such as Stacks, Queue, Arrays, Dictionaries, etc. to solve more implementation problems

3. Learn algorithm techniques:

	* Programming paradigms

	* Search algorithms

	* Greedy algorithms

	* Dynamic programming
  
	* and Divide and Conquer

4. By this time, you should be comfortable with terms like:
	* BFS
	* DFS
	* backtracking
	* recursion
	* Top Down DP, Bottom up DP, Memorization, Sorting, Segment Trees, Red-Black trees, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, etc.

5. Bonus Expert level:
  After completing the previous steps, you are good to go for all general programming and can call yourself a BEGINNER. Now, you can look at specific algorithms in Strings, Graph Theory, Mathematics, Game Theory, other advanced algorithms and data structures.
